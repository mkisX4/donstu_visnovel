      - dezmond_unknown says: You're not going to try to run away or do anything else stupid? Smart choice. I suppose you want to know who I am and what's going to happen to you now?
      - dezmond says: "So let's go in order: The name's Dezmond. Humble scav brigade leader."
      - dezmond says: And you will be forced to come to our ship. Quickly and without further questions. It's in your best interest.

          - dezmond says: Perhaps I overestimated your intelligence. That's a shame. Unfortunately, you don't have a choice. If there's a need, these gentlemen will make sure you come nicely.
          - text: Resisting an armed squad in armor alone is not only pointless, but deadly. Looks like you'll have to comply for now.

    - "Start to panic and do something stupid":
      - text: In a fit of panic, you look around, trying to find shelter and figure out an escape route. Turning toward the rusted-out hulk of some machinery, you're about to run for your life.
      - effect SHAKE:
      - text: Before you can get to your target, you hear a squeezed clack and something hits you from behind on the shoulder and you feel your body stiffen with a steely grip of paralysis.
      - text: You want to turn your head and see what hit you, but your body refuses to obey. Meanwhile, the stranger once again stood before you and started talking.
      - show dezmond_unknown: WITH FADE CONTINUE
      - dezmond_unknown says: We're pretty sharp, aren't we? I'm afraid it won't help you this time.
      - dezmond says: The name's Dezmond. Me and my humble crew have come there to get you. Whether you like it or not.

          - text: Gradually the numbness goes away. There may be more than one scavenger in front of you, but there's no way you can just give up like that!
          - text: When you felt your body obeying you again you decided to throw yourself at the man in front of you and either die in an unequal fight or emerge victorious and use him as a hostage in bargaining for your freedom.

          - dezmond says: Guess people like you don't want to give up so easily, huh? I almost want you on the crew.
